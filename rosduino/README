Install ros arduino library:
http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup
Other tutorials are available there too

coding style:
- because arduino ide is unwilling to hide files, libraries which do not need accessing often (mostly anything not written by us) are denoted by "z_" so that they are sorted at the end
- anything local for a cpp file begins with "_"
- mark anything unfinished "TODO" so that it can be found easily
